1  EXT.  LAS VEGAS (STOCK FOTTAGE) - NIGHT

GRAPHIC:  1967 - SOMEWHERE IN NEVADA

It is set against the obvious skyline of Las Vegas.

2  INT.  DR. EVIL'S PRIVATE QUARTERS - DAY

The lair is 1960's high-tech.  We see a huge oversized conference table with six scary-looking
EVIL ASSOCIATES, including a Latin American REVOLUTIONARY in a field jacket and turtleneck, TWIN
NORDIC DOCTORS, and a METER MAID.

ANGLE ON:  A RING WITH DR. EVIL'S INSIGNIA ON IT.  The ringed hand is stroking a WHITE FLUFFY
CAT.

                                        DR. EVIL
                                  (face always unseen)
         Gentlemen, are we all here?  Good.  As you know, my plot to high-jack
         nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage has failed.  Again.  This
         organization will not tolerate failure.

He presses a button.  The Revolutionary, the twin Nordic doctors, and the meter maid's chairs tip
back and fall into a pit.  Their chairs return empty and smoking.

                                        DR. EVIL
         Mustafa...

ANGLE ON:  MUSTAFA, an Arab with a red Fez.

                                        DR. EVIL
         Frau Farbissina...

ANGLE ON FRAU FARBISSINA in a severe Salvation Army uniform.

                                        DR. EVIL
         I spared your lives because I need you to help me rid the world of the only
         man who can stop me now.  We must go to London.  I've set a trap for Austin
         Powers!
